## What Do We Do?    
We study the physical and biogeochemical processes in coastal, shelf, and deep oceans. We achieve this by analyzing long-term monitoring data (in situ + remote sensing) and employing cross-scale modeling systems that capture the critical interactions between climate and ocean. As the climate rapidly changes and extreme weather events become more frequent, the resiliency of coastal ecosystems and communities is put to the test. In response, our lab is at the forefront of investigating how these climate events reshape coastal ocean dynamics, thereby establishing a connection between physical dynamics and pressing environmental issues such as marine heat waves, eutrophication, and microplastic pollutants. Our primary tool is advanced numerical modeling, but we rely heavily on a variety of observation data to identify interesting phenomena and calibrate our model systems. We also develop automomous vehicle, the "marine robot", as our key platform for future field surveys. 

## Why Numerical Modeling?

Numerical models are the best tools for providing a synoptic view of three-dimensional physical processes to better understand what is happening in the ocean. They are powerful tools for integrating in-situ measurements and remote sensing data in a mathematics-based three-dimensional world. Numerical models are also the only way we can predict future conditions and do large-scale experiments on our planet. 

## Why Marine Robots?

Reliable scientific findings depend on consistent observation. Marine robots are becoming the essential tools for exploring our oceans, particularly during extreme weather events like hurricanes. While traditional survey vessels are often restricted by dangerous conditions, autonomous aquatic vehicles can continue their missions. Step by step, our lab is engineering cost-efficient, versatile robots designed to transform the future of coastal water surveys.
