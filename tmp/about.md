## We develop and use advanced technologies to explore the frontiers of ocean science!

## Research Focus: What Do We Do?    
We study the physical and biogeochemical processes in coastal, shelf, and deep oceans. Our work integrates long-term monitoring data (in situ and remote sensing) with multi-scale modeling systems to capture critical interactions between the climate and the ocean. 

As the climate changes and extreme weather events become more frequent, the resiliency of coastal ecosystems and communities is increasingly threatened. Our lab investigates how these climate events reshape coastal ocean dynamics, linking physical processes to pressing environmental issues such as **marine heatwaves, eutrophication, and microplastic pollution**. While advanced numerical modeling is our primary tool, we rely heavily on diverse observational datasets to identify novel phenomena and calibrate our systems. Additionally, we develop **autonomous marine robots** as key platforms for next-generation field surveys.


## Why Numerical Modeling?

Numerical models are the most effective tools for providing a synoptic, three-dimensional view of oceanographic processes. They allow us to integrate sparse in-situ measurements and satellite data into a mathematically consistent 3D environment. Furthermore, numerical models are the only means by which we can predict future conditions and conduct large-scale "what-if" experiments to understand our changing planet.

## Why Marine Robots?

Reliable scientific discovery depends on consistent observation. Marine robots are becoming essential for exploring our oceans, particularly during extreme weather events like hurricanes when conditions are too dangerous for traditional research vessels. Our lab is engineering cost-efficient, versatile autonomous vehicles designed to transform the future of coastal water surveys and ensure data continuity in the harshest environments.
